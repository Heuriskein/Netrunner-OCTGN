Netrunner CCG plugin for OCTGN
=========================

Considered by most one of the best Card Games ever conceived, Netrunner is an asymmetrical Cyberpunk CCG that everyone should play at least once.

Note: This is just the game engine, you'll also need to download [the sets](http://octgn.gamersjudgement.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=361). If you've never played the Netrunner before, you can find [some links to check out here](http://octgn.gamersjudgement.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=208&sid=253a1e9b14f4c47f0796b3301fa117c6)

Gameplay
--------

Some basic instructions on how to use the new system will be forthcoming, but things should be fairly intuitive anyway. Some basic things to remember

* First thing you do after you load a deck is Setup (Ctrl+Shift+S)
* At the start of your turn, declare it with F1
* At the end of your turn, declare it with F12. Make sure the game announces that your turn has ended and is not expecting you to discard down to your max hand size ;)
* Play/Install cards from your hand by double-clicking them. Use cards on the table in the same way. 
* Always try to Trash or Uninstall cards by using the relevant function in the menu (e.g. 'del' key)
  * If you want to trash the card of an opponent, _first let them know_ then target the card (shift+click) and use the "Trash Target" options in the **table menu** (i.e. right-click on an empty spot on the table)
* Only ever drag & drop cards from your hand to the table, or from the table/hand to your trash, if there's no other way.

And some more advanced stuff:

* If you're the corp, remove all viruses by double-clicking your "Virus Scan" card. If you're the runner, remove Sentry markers by double-clicking on your "Technical Difficulties" card.
* Most card will automatically trigger their abilities when played/scored/rezzed so you don't need to do anything else. Pay attention to the notification area for messages from them.
* Cards with abilities which increase your MU, Hand Size, etc will automatically increase it when they come into play and reduce it when they go away, as long as you don't drag&drop them in or out of the table manually. Use the built-in commands for that. Rez, Derez, Trash etc
* Cards with abilities you activate while they're in play (like programs, agendas, upgrades etc) will trigger them when you double-click on them. If they have more than one ability (such as most icebreakers), the game will prompt you to select one and pay the appropriate cost.
* Cards which reduce the cost of other card's abilities, will also automatically work. If you have a card which has tokens which can pay the cost for activating icebreakers, they will be automatically used when you use one such ability. If you have more than one of these cards which can affect such costs they will be triggered in the order you put them on the table. If you wanted to use the tokens from another card instead, you can simply drag the token manually to the other card afterwards.
* There are cards which will automatically do damage to your opponent and thus discard random cards from their hand. Due to the way OCTGN works, this may crash the game if you opponent was manipulating the same card. There is a warning before all such damage that will warn you to inform your opponent to be hands-off while the effect is in progress. This warning will also give your opponent the opportunity to play cards which prevent damage.
* Yes, cards which reduce damage taken have been automated and work automatically depending on the kind of damage you take. As before, they too get triggered by the order they've been put on the table, so if you didn't want to lose the counters from one particular card, just drag them in from the card you did want to use.
* Some cards require that you select a target from the table or your hand. Do this before you play or activate the card. If you don't the action will abort and the game will inform you to select your targets first.  As always, keep your eye on the chatbox for such warnings.
* Cards which have effects which trigger at start/end of turn (i.e. refilling bit markers on them) will automatically work.
* Cards which put markers on a player, which __themselves__ have an automated ability (i.e. Fang, Baskerville, Armageddon etc) will _also_ automatically work.
* If you don't like some or all the automations, you can disable some or all of them. Go to the game menu, and you can disable damage automations (i.e. your opponent will have to use the damage options manually), Damage Prevention, Turn Start/End automations and Play/Score/Rez Automations (i.e. mostly everything). If you find that you'd rather do everything manually, just disable all of them and you'll have an experience as with most generic card game engines.
* Cards with multiple effects will request you to select one of them when you activate them. Select an ability by putting their number in the window that pop's up. You should be able to get the idea of which ability is each from the parsed script.

Phew, that should be the most basic things about the new automations. If you're not sure if a card is automated, simply use the 'Inspect' function and the game will inform you of the details.

Honorary mentions of complex cards that I've managed to automate:
* Arasaka Owns You
* Mystery Box
* Playful AI
* The Shell Traders
* Emergency Self Construct

and many many more

Enjoy!

We are DONE ladies, gentlepeeps and people in between. Finished! Fertig! Finito! Τέλος!
Version 3.0.0 marks the end of active development for this plugin by me. There may still be bugfixes and perhaps minor tweaks here and there, but the main functionality is all there.

I'll now be concentrating my efforts into porting this plugin to run Android: Netrunner. Expect the same level of goodness there ;)

So, final changes for this version

 * Memory check now made a function. Will also work for cards installed via shell traders

Changes and bugfixes far too numerous to mention. Needless to say this is a huge update. 

At this moment only the core set is such automated. The other sets are still usable but might need to edit their definitions to make them compatible (Will release a patch)

### 2.0.8.2

* No more crashing scripts when player closes windows that ask for numbers
* Increased the chat font-size to 11 to be more visible on high resolutions (eg 1920x1080)

### 2.0.7

* Added ⏎ character on the chatbox, when the player takes an action, to be able to distinguish those notifications better.
  * Important, because of the above change, you'll have to delete your old chat fonts if you're on windows XP and see a square instead of the Enter character. Simply delete the ```%USERPROFILE%\My Documents\Octgn\Games\13568561-7a2e-4572-8f31-3d99580ab245\cmd64.ttf``` file.
* Paying Action now take into account your max actions (as modified by cards and the player)

* Added more autoscripting. (Toon)
  * Runs
  * Losing tags
  * Rolling Dice

### 2.0.3

* Fixed automations for cards like Cortical Cybermodem.


### 2.0.2

* Cards with MU cost now announce how much it is when they installed, and return it back to their owner when they're trashed.
* Fixed +MU card giving double the bonuses.

### 2.0.1

* Agenda scoring should now work for the runner.
* Fixe bug where Corp Upgrades were being installed face-up
* Put a warning in case people try to start a game without a two-sided-table
* Scored agendas now moved to the scoring player's side and stacked.

### 2.0.0

The latest release of the co-operation between Db0 and toon. Netrunner 2.0.0 is released!

* Autoscripts are now working without errors. This means that many of the cards that do something fairly simple, like drawing 3 cards, or increasing your handsize, now do that automatically.
* Function to disable Autoscripts in the game menu
* New each card has only one "Keywords" field instead of 5 separate ones. This means that filtering cards by their traits is much easier in the deck editor. This will require [a patching of your existing sets](https://github.com/downloads/db0/Netrunner-OCTGN/Patch_2.0.0.o8p)

Due to the significant changes in this version, it is strongly suggested that you delete your OCTGN\Database folder after patching. OCTGN should automatically reinstall all your games the next time you start it (If not, just go to options, select Install on Launch and restart OCTGN)
Don't forget to download the latest markers file as well.

Also keep in mind that the current (as of 20/04/2012) stable versions of OCTGN do not support the custom fonts that are enabled by the game. If you see squares where you should be seeing characters, (or if you just want to experience the awesomeness) use the [OCTGN Beta 4](https://github.com/downloads/Gravecorp/OCTGN/beta4.zip).

### 1.5.11

* Added Commodore 64 fonts for the chat box

### 1.5.10

* Changed some wordings.
* Agenda Points scored now visible on player summary.
* Changed the hand "Trash Card" actions to "Trash/Archive" to be more descriptive.

### 1.5.5

* Made The "Declare Start of Turn", "Declare End of Turn" more central to the game. It supposed to work as follows
  * At the start of your turn, you press F1 to declare the start of your turn. This also reinitializes your actions and makes some further checks for mistakes
  * When you're done with your turn, you press F12 to declare the end of your turn. It does some further checks and if it realizes that you have more cards in your hand than your handsize, it puts you in the "End Turn Phase" where you have to discard your excess cards
  * When done with discarding, you press F12 again and after some internal checks, the game announces the end of your turn.
* The mandatory draw action has been removed as its own unique entity. It has been merged into the normal card draw action, but to work correctly you need to use the end turn, start turn actions appropriately.

* Added action to change your Action limit per turn. THis is used when they are automatically refreshed at Turn Start.

### 1.5.4

* Started using unicode "Return" character to denote which options require the use of an Action.
* Started using unicode [Dingbats](http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/dingbats.html) 10102 to 10111 to denote which options require the payment of bits. The getBit() function also uses them in its message.
* Removed the Brain damage counter and now using only the hand size one. The hand size counter has the brain icon now.
